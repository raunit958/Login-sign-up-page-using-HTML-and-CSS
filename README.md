# Login-sign-up-page-using-HTML-and-CSS
This is a simple, responsive Login/Sign-Up form built using HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates how to create clean, user-friendly form layouts for both login and sign-up functionality. The form includes input fields for user credentials such as Username, Email (for Sign-Up), and Password.



Features:
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, making the form mobile-friendly.

Form Switching: The user can toggle between the Login and Sign-Up forms with a smooth transition effect using only CSS and a bit of JavaScript for toggling.

Styled Inputs: Inputs are styled with focus effects to enhance usability, and buttons have hover animations for better interaction.

Simple and Clean UI: The design follows modern UI/UX principles with a minimalistic style, making the form easy to use and visually appealing.

Technologies Used:
HTML: The basic structure of the form is created with HTML.

CSS: Styles are applied to create a responsive layout and modern design.

JavaScript: Used for toggling between the Login and Sign-Up forms when the user clicks on the respective links.

How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your browser to view the form in action.

The Login form appears by default, and you can switch to the Sign-Up form by clicking the "Sign Up" link and vice versa.

Customization:
You can easily customize the colors, fonts, and styling to fit your personal or projectâ€™s branding.

To add functionality like form validation, integration with back-end services (e.g., API requests), or more advanced form features, you can extend this project with JavaScript.
